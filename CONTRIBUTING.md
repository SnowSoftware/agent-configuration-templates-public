### Suggestions - no knowledge required

Is there some functionality missing?  
Is the behavior of our configuration templates wrong?  
File a suggestion on the [Snow Ideas Portal](https://ideas.snowsoftware.com) and we will discuss the best way to solve your problems, but always search to see, if anyone already has reported the same suggestion before posting a new one.
